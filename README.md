## ⚠️ Disclaimer (Must Read)

This software operates solely on **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** and **simulated mouse/keyboard clicks**. It **does not** read or modify any game memory.

* **Safety**: While theoretically safe, using automation scripts in online environments always carries risk.
* **Recommendation**: **Strongly recommended for use in Offline Mode or with EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) disabled.**
* **Liability**: This tool is for educational purposes only. The author is not responsible for any bans resulting from online use.
* **Fair Play**: Not intended for malicious Save-Load (SL) exploits.

## ✨ Features

* **Auto-Recognition**: Automatically identifies relic attributes using OCR.
* **Dual Modes**: Supports both "Normal" and "Deepnight" relic modes.
* **Smart Filtering**:
    * **Custom Presets**: Define multiple desired attribute combinations (e.g., "Phys Atk + HP" for melee, "Magic Atk + Crit" for mages).
    * **Logic**: If a relic matches 2 or more attributes from *any* active preset, it is **kept**. Otherwise, it is automatically **sold**.
* **Blacklist System**: Automatically detects and sells relics with "fatal" negative attributes (e.g., "HP Drain") defined in your blacklist.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  **Launch**:
    * Open the game and stand in front of the **Pot Merchant** or the **Collector** interface.
    * Run `NRrelic_Bot.exe`.
2.  **Configure**:
    * Select your mode (Normal/Deepnight).
    * Add your desired attribute presets in the software.
3.  **Start AFK**:
    * In the game, aim your crosshair/cursor at the item you want to purchase.
    * Click the **Start** button on the bot.
    * The bot will automatically loop: `Buy -> Scan -> Keep/Sell`.
